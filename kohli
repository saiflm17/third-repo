1. TITLE :
Kubernetes-Based Canary Deployment using Kubernetes(KOPS Cluster) and Istio .

2. INTRODUCTION :
Modern application development demands fast and reliable deployment strategies. Canary deployment is a release technique that reduces the risk of 
introducing a new software version by gradually shifting traffic from the old version to the new version. This project demonstrates a canary deployment model 
using kubernetes(KOPS Cluster) and Istio, a service mesh platform, to control traffic flow between different versions of a deployed application.
The goal is to simulate real-world DevOps practices with traffic routing, performance monitoring, and rollbacks or promotions based on application behavior.

3. ABSTRACT :
This project simulates a canary deployment strategy on a Kubernetes(KOPS Cluster) environment.Two versions of a web application are deployed. 
 Using Istio, traffic is split between the stable (v1) and the canary (v2) versions â€” initially 80% to v1 and 20% to v2.

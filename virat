1. TITLE :
GitOps-Based CI/CD Pipeline using ArgoCD and Kubernetes .

2. INTRODUCTION :
Modern DevOps practices demand continuous, reliable, and scalable deployment mechanisms. GitOps simplifies this by using Git as the single source of truth for
Kubernetes cluster configuration and application deployment. This project demonstrates a practical implementation of GitOps using ArgoCD to automatically 
sync and deploy Kubernetes manifests files from a GitHub repository.

3.ABSTRACT :
This project aims to showcase how GitOps principles can be applied to automate the deployment and lifecycle management of applications on Kubernetes using ARGOCD.

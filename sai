1. TITLE

CI/CD Pipeline for Zomato Application using Node.js, Docker, Kubernetes(kops cluster), and GitHub Actions .

2. INTRODUCTION

Modern application development demands automated pipelines to ensure continuous integration and delivery. This project demonstrates how to containerize a 
Node.js Zomato application and automate its build-test-deploy lifecycle using GitHub Actions for CI/CD, Docker for containerize the application and 
Deployment is handled by using kubernetes on kops cluster .

3. ABSTRACT

This project demonstrates the implementation of a CI/CD pipeline for the Zomato application using Docker containers, GitHub Actions, and Kubernetes(Kops) Pods.
The pipeline automatically builds Docker images, to build the code, runs unit tests, pushes images to Docker Hub, and deploys them using kubernetes(Kops). In
this project a zomato application am deploying in two ways and the first way is docker-compose am creating docker containers to run the application and the 
second one is kubernetes (kops cluster) am creating Pods to run the application. The pipeline is ensures consistent, automated and making it suitable for local
environments and learning devops practices.

4. TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED 

Git, GitHub, Node.js Jenkins, GitHub Actins for CI/CD Automation, Docker, Docker-Compose, DockerHub, Kubernetes(Kops Cluster), Kubectl .
